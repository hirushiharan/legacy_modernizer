# Complete Legacy App Modernization Guide

An autonomous AI workflow system designed for migrating any legacy applications to modern technology stacks.

## 🎯 What This Does

This system provides a structured, autonomous approach to legacy application modernization with:

- **Comprehensive Business Analysis**: Extracts business requirements and creates detailed documentation
- **Technical Migration Planning**: Creates reverse engineering documents with specific migration rules
- **Automated Implementation**: Generates modern applications following extracted requirements
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures functional parity and business logic preservation

## 🏗️ Detailed Migration Workflow: Copy & Paste System Prompt

**Use this system prompt in AI Agent chat to start your legacy application to modern technology stack migration:**

**STEP 1: Project Structure Setup**
- Create two folders: legacy_app and modern_app
- Generate the Legacy App project structure
- Keep the Legacy App & project structure analysis inside the legacy_app folder

**STEP 2: Legacy Application Analysis**

'''From this project structure analyse the Legacy App Project Structure, Core Application Modules, Database, Key features and Technology Stack'''

**STEP 3: Requirements Engineering**

Mention your Legacy application & Modern application tech stack in the below prompt

'''I want to migrate my existing legacy application which is in <LEGACY_APP_TECH_STACK> to modern application where the frontend is in <FRONTEND_TECH_STACK> and the backend is in <BACKEND_TECH_STACK>. I want you to be my autonomous AI developer for this migration task. First, I want you to update the project_config.md file based on your project analysis. Then I want you to create the BRD (Business Requirements Document) with all the requirements and also the BRED (Business Reverse Engineering Document) including all the reverse engineering rules. Keep the extracted BRDs inside the modern_app/extracted_brd and the BREDs inside the modern_app/extracted_bred.'''

**STEP 4: Follow Migration Instructions**

'''Now I want you to follow these instructions and migrate the legacy app to modern app based on the project_config.md.

Sources of truth  
• project_config.md – goal, tech stack, constraints, ## Changelog  
• workflow_state.md – ## State, Plan, Rules, Items, Log, ArchiveLog  
Ignore all other memory.

Operating loop  
1. Read workflow_state.md → note Phase & Status  
2. Read project_config.md → recall standards & constraints  
3. Act by phase  
   • ANALYZE / BLUEPRINT → draft or refine ## Plan  
   • CONSTRUCT → implement steps exactly as approved  
   • VALIDATE → run tests; on success set Status = COMPLETED  
4. Write back to workflow_state.md  
   • Append brief reasoning/tool output to ## Log (≤ 2 000 chars per write)  
   • Apply automatic rules  
     – RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01: if ## Log > 5 000 chars → summarise top 5 to ## ArchiveLog, then clear ## Log  
     – RULE_SUMMARY_01: after successful VALIDATE → prepend one‑sentence summary as a new list item under ## Changelog in project_config.md  
5. Repeat or await user input

Etiquette  
• For any new idea first enter BLUEPRINT, store the step-by-step plan in ## Plan, set Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL, and wait for confirmation  
• Produce complete, idiomatic code; no TODOs or placeholders  
• Follow naming, security, and style rules from project_config.md  
• Keep prose minimal; prefer code, bullets, or tables  
• Work strictly within the IDE and these two markdown files
• Generate and place all generated code & files inside the respective folders inside /modern_app.'''

**STEP 5: Final Testing & Deployment**

'''Now I want to run & test the migrated modern application. Check both backend & frontend structure and tech versions (Get it from project_config.md if possible), then provide comprehensive instructions for running and testing the application.'''

## 🔄 How It Works: The Core Idea

The AI operates in a loop:
1. It reads the current situation and rules from `workflow_state.md`.
2. It decides what to do next based on those rules and the task plan.
3. It uses AI Agent features (like editing code or running commands in the terminal) to perform the action.
4. It records what happened in `workflow_state.md`.
5. It automatically manages log size and preserves insights via rotation and summarization.
6. It repeats the cycle.

For legacy app modernization, this translates to a structured migration loop:
1. **Project Setup**: Creates the proper folder structure and analyzes the legacy application
2. **Business Analysis**: Extracts comprehensive business requirements and reverse engineering rules
3. **Migration Planning**: Creates detailed migration strategies and implementation plans
4. **Implementation**: Builds the modern application following the extracted requirements
5. **Testing & Validation**: Ensures the migrated application meets all business requirements

This allows the AI to handle complex migration tasks autonomously, preserving business logic while modernizing the technology stack.

## 📋 The Two Key Files

1. **`project_config.md` (Long-Term Memory):**
   - Contains the stable basics of your project, such as main goals, technologies used, important coding rules, and limitations.
   - Includes an auto-populated `## Changelog` section that tracks completed work summaries with dates.
   - Think of it as the project's "constitution." The AI reads it to understand the big picture. You set this up once and update it rarely.

2. **`workflow_state.md` (Dynamic State, Rules & Log):**
   - This is the AI's main workspace file. It's constantly read and updated.
   - **`## State`:** Shows the current workflow phase (Analyze, Blueprint, Construct, Validate) and status (Ready, Blocked, etc.).
   - **`## Plan`:** Holds the step-by-step plan for the current task (created by the AI in the Blueprint phase).
   - **`## Rules`:** Contains *all* the rules the AI follows for workflow, memory, tools, error handling, **and now log management**.
   - **`## Log`:** Records everything the AI does and observes during the session. **NEW:** Automatically rotated when it exceeds 5,000 characters.
   - **`## ArchiveLog`:** **NEW:** Stores condensed summaries of rotated logs to preserve important findings.

*(The old `memory-bank/` and `.cursor/rules/` directories are **no longer used** by this system.)*

- Ensure `workflow_state.md` shows the current phase and status
- Verify that BRD and BRED documents are complete before implementation

**If code generation fails:**
- Confirm all requirements are documented in BRD
- Check that BRED contains specific technical mapping rules
- Ensure project_config.md specifies the correct technology stack

**If testing fails:**
- Validate that all business logic from BRD is implemented
- Check that database connections are properly configured
- Ensure frontend and backend are communicating correctly

## 📝 Example Migration Flow

1. **Place Legacy App**: Copy legacy application to `legacy_app/`
2. **Start Analysis**: AI analyzes structure and extracts requirements
3. **Generate Documents**: BRD and BRED created automatically
4. **Build Modern App**: Modern frontend and backend generated
5. **Test and Validate**: Comprehensive testing ensures functional parity
