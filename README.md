# Code Modernization Tool

A comprehensive application designed to modernize legacy codebases by upgrading them from outdated technology stacks to modern, maintainable solutions.

## Overview

This tool automates the process of analyzing legacy code and provides intelligent recommendations for modernizing your applications. It helps identify deprecated patterns, suggests modern alternatives, and guides you through the modernization process step by step.

## Features

- **Automated Code Analysis**: Scans your codebase to identify outdated patterns and technologies
- **Smart Recommendations**: Provides context-aware suggestions for modern alternatives
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Offers detailed instructions for the modernization process
- **Configuration-Driven**: Customizable through project configuration files
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works with various programming languages and frameworks

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:
- Access to the legacy codebase you want to modernize
- Basic understanding of the target modern technology stack
- Appropriate development environment set up

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd code_modernization
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   # Add specific installation commands based on your tech stack
   ```

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Configure Your Project
1. Update the `project_config.md` file with your project-specific details
2. Specify your current technology stack and target modernization goals
3. Set any custom preferences or constraints

### Step 2: Run the Analysis
1. Open the `instructions.md` file
2. Follow the **System Prompt** instructions provided
3. Execute the analysis on your codebase

### Step 3: Follow the Modernization Steps
1. Review the generated modernization plan
2. Implement the suggested changes incrementally
3. Test each modification to ensure functionality is preserved
4. Document any custom adaptations made during the process

## Configuration

The tool uses configuration files to customize the modernization process:

- **`project_config.md`**: Contains project-specific settings and preferences
- **`instructions.md`**: Provides detailed system prompts and operational guidelines

## Usage Examples

### Basic Modernization Workflow
1. Configure your project - Edit project_config.md with your project details
2. Run the analysis - Follow instructions in instructions.md
3. Apply modernization steps - Implement the generated recommendations

## Best Practices

- **Incremental Approach**: Modernize your code in small, manageable chunks
- **Testing**: Maintain comprehensive tests throughout the modernization process
- **Version Control**: Use git branches to track each modernization step
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of changes made and rationale
- **Backup**: Always maintain backups of your original codebase

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the modernization process:

1. Check the configuration files for accuracy
2. Ensure all prerequisites are met
3. Review the error logs for specific guidance
4. Consult the instructions.md file for detailed troubleshooting steps
