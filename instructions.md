Migration Tasks

1. Update project_config.md
   1. Incorporate insights from your previous project analysis.
   2. Do not modify any other files in this step.
   3. The modern codebase already contains boilerplates under modern_app/code/; use only <FRONTEND_TECH_STACK>, <BACKEND_TECH_STACK>, and <DATABASE>.

2. Create BRD (Business Requirements Document)
   1. Perform an exhaustive walkthrough of the legacy application (all front-end and back-end paths).
   2. Capture at minimum:
      - Project overview
      - Functional & non-functional requirements
      - Business rules
      - Use cases
      - Success criteria
      - Assumptions & dependencies
      - Risk assessments
   3. Add any additional topics that are relevant; omit any that clearly do not apply.
   4. Save each BRD to modern_app/extracted_brd/ following the naming rule brd_<module>.md.

3. Create BRED (Business Reverse Engineering Document)
   1. Analyse system internals: architecture, feature set, coding patterns, legacy-to-modern mapping, QA rules, risk mitigations.
   2. Map every legacy feature to its modern equivalent.
   3. Add missing but relevant topics; skip irrelevant ones.
   4. Store each BRED in modern_app/extracted_bred/ with the name bred_<module>.md.

4. Document Legacy Database Architecture
   1. Detail (include or omit items as appropriate):
      - Schema, tables, fields, relationships
      - Core entity groups & detailed entity relationships
      - Indexing strategy & performance optimisations
      - Constraints, business rules & security considerations
      - Data retention, backup & recovery
      - Data-migration mapping to <DATABASE>
   2. Place outputs in modern_app/database/ (file names: db_<topic>.md).

5. Document Overall System Architecture
   1. System-level: component, data, security, deployment, migration, monitoring/observability *(add extra relevant subsections, omit non-applicable ones).*
   2. Frontend: project structure, component hierarchy, state management, real-time communication, service registration & configuration, styling/theme, performance optimisation *(extend/trim as needed).*
   3. API design: endpoints, authentication & authorization, module APIs, error handling, rate limiting, versioning *(extend/trim as needed).*
   4. Database: reference work from Task 4.
   5. Save files in modern_app/architecture/ (names: arch_<layer>.md).

Conventions & Governance

1. Directory & File-Naming
   - Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names (brd_customer-management.md).
   - All documents are Markdown (.md) that begin with an H1 title and <!-- [toc] --> for auto TOC.

2. Diagrams
   - Embed Mermaid or PlantUML snippets inline.
   - Larger images go to modern_app/architecture/diagrams/ (PNG or SVG, 16:9 aspect).

3. Cross-Referencing & Traceability
   - Link related sections across BRD, BRED and architecture docs with relative paths.
   - Provide a traceability matrix (traceability_matrix.md) mapping legacy items to modern components.

4. Definition of Done / Quality Gates
   - ≥ 80 % unit-test coverage on generated .NET code skeletons.
   - Pass dotnet format, eslint, and markdownlint in CI.

5. Iteration Cadence & Checkpoints
   - Commit one atomic PR per numbered task.
   - After every commit, update progress-summary.md in repo root (≤ 200 words).

6. Risk & Dependency Flags
   - Tag unknown external integrations with TODO:<owner> comments.

7. Security & Compliance
   - Include STRIDE threat-models and OWASP ASVS mappings in architecture docs.

8. Performance Budgets
   - Target P99 API latency ≤ 300 ms under 500 RPS; document SLOs/SLIs in BRD.

9. Placeholder Handling
   - If any <…> placeholder remains unresolved, fail fast and raise an issue.

10. Deliverable Checklist (for workflow promotion)
    - project_config.md updated.
    - All BRDs in modern_app/extracted_brd/.
    - All BREDs in modern_app/extracted_bred/.
    - Legacy DB docs in modern_app/database/.
    - Architecture docs (and diagrams) in modern_app/architecture/ + modern_app/architecture/diagrams/.
    - traceability_matrix.md present.
    - progress-summary.md updated after every task.

Etiquette

- Do not modify workflow_state.md at this stage.
- For every section or subtopic listed above, add it if the legacy application requires it, and omit it if it is not applicable.
- Any folders/documents you are creating, create it only inside modern_app folder.
'''

**STEP 4: Follow Migration Instructions**

'''Now I want you to follow these instructions and migrate the legacy app to modern app based on the project_config.md.

Sources of truth  
• project_config.md – goal, tech stack, constraints, ## Changelog  
• workflow_state.md – ## State, Plan, Rules, Items, Log, ArchiveLog  
Ignore all other memory.

Operating loop  
1. Read workflow_state.md → note Phase & Status  
2. Read project_config.md → recall standards & constraints
3. Review generated architecture, database, BRD & BRED documents in modern_app/ for a full grasp of the legacy system and target structure.
4. Act by phase  
   • ANALYZE / BLUEPRINT → draft or refine ## Plan.
   • CONSTRUCT → implement steps exactly as approved  
   • VALIDATE → run tests; on success set Status = COMPLETED
5. Split phases into small tasks. Fully implement & test each task before starting the next.
6. Write back to workflow_state.md  
   • Append brief reasoning/tool output to ## Log (≤ 2 000 chars per write)  
   • Apply automatic rules  
     – RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01: if ## Log > 5 000 chars → summarise top 5 to ## ArchiveLog, then clear ## Log  
     – RULE_SUMMARY_01: after successful VALIDATE → prepend one‑sentence summary as a new list item under ## Changelog in project_config.md  
7. Repeat or await user input

Etiquette  
• For any new idea first enter BLUEPRINT, store the step-by-step plan in ## Plan, set Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL, and wait for confirmation  
• Produce complete, idiomatic code; no TODOs or placeholders  
• Follow naming, security, and style rules from project_config.md  
• Keep prose minimal; prefer code, bullets, or tables  
• Work strictly within the IDE and these two markdown files. If necessory, refer the generated marckdown files inside modern_app/.
• Generate and place all code & files in their correct sub-folders under /modern_app.'''

**STEP 5: Final Testing & Deployment**

'''Now I want to run & test the migrated modern application. Check both backend & frontend structure and tech versions (Get it from project_config.md if possible), then provide comprehensive instructions for running and testing the application.'''
